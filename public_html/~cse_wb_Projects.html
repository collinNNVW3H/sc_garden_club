<p>We have a very exciting fall planned for this school year.</p>
<p>Thus far we have planted rutabagas. Later on this semester we</p>
<p>will grow Heliopolis, beauty berries, heather and pansies.</p>
<p>We will be holding a poll sometime later this semester where</p>
<p>we will allow students of Simpson College to vote on next</p>
<p>semester's plants.</p>

    <h2> Past Projects</h2>

<p> Last year was quite busy, but very successful. We were able to grow</p>
<p> four vegetables and five flowers during the school year. In the fall</p>
<p> we grew turnips, sedum, chrysanthemums and for Halloween, pumpkins. </p>
<p> Spring was just as fun. We were able to plant and grow avocados, radishes,</p>
<p> peonies, pink tulips and primroses. </p>
